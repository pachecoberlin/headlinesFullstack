# Full Stack JVM & JS App for Scraping News from websites

This repository is forked from the code corresponding to the hands-on lab [Building a Full Stack Web App with Kotlin Multiplatform](https://play.kotlinlang.org/hands-on/Full%20Stack%20Web%20App%20with%20Kotlin%20Multiplatform/).

**The master branch contains a backend which scrapes News (mostly headlines) from some news sites. The frontend shows them and provides a field to filter them by text. The filtering is done via backend, probably not the most performant.
