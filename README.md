# Full Stack JVM & JS App for Scraping News from websites

Simple but works. Releases are packed for windows. Java has to be installed. Get Latest release zipfile, extract, run bin\shoppinglist.bat, open browser, put address localhost:9090 and have fun.

**The master branch contains a backend which scrapes News (mostly headlines) from some news sites. The frontend shows them and provides a field to filter them by text. The filtering is done via backend, probably not the most performant.**

This repository is forked from the code corresponding to the hands-on lab [Building a Full Stack Web App with Kotlin Multiplatform](https://play.kotlinlang.org/hands-on/Full%20Stack%20Web%20App%20with%20Kotlin%20Multiplatform/).
